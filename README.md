- **This patch only works on the NTSC-U/C version of the game.** 
  - There are no plans to make a version for PAL or NTSC-J.
- **Do not patch a pre-patched ISO.** The patch only applies to a vanilla copy of the game.
- No ISO files are provided here. Distributing ISOs is illegal, so you'll need to provide your own legal backup of the game.
