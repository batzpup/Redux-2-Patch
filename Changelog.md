# Redux II - Mod Overview

Welcome to **Redux II**! This file provides useful information about the mod. If you're familiar with the [**All Cards Mod**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPyH5HiRlwg), all those changes are present in Redux II. However, like the original [**Redux**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Aa2xC0Gig), all the duels are different.  
At the start of the game, you will only be able to select the White Rose campaign. This is normal. You must complete this first, then you may start on the **Red Rose** side. Virtually all changes you notice in Redux II are intentional.

## If You're New to Redux or All Cards Mod  
If you're not familiar with the original **Redux** mod or the **All Cards Mod**, here's a quick overview of what Redux II carries over:  
- **All cards are obtainable**.
- **Ranking up is faster** (+ all monsters will gain the hidden card find and bonus slots).

### New Features in Redux II
Redux II introduces several new features that were not present in the original **Redux** (which debuted in the All Cards Mod), including:
- **Fuse Rituals in the Hand**: You can now fuse ritual monsters directly from your hand with the ritual card and its core monster.
- **AI Improvements**: The annoying AI behavior of double-tapping cards has been removed.
- **Duel Room Feature**: In **Custom Duel**, press the shoulder buttons to scroll through duels.
- **Intro Cutscene Skipping**: The intro cutscene is now automatically skipped.
- **Updated Leader Ability Trees**: Leader ability trees have been updated, and the card drop pool is now identical to the All Cards Mod, making it far easier to obtain cards than in the original Redux.
- **Reincarnation After Every Duel**: You can reincarnate after every duel instead of waiting for every 5 duels.
- **No Deck Cost Restriction**: There is no longer a deck cost restriction in the post-game.
- **Duelist Music Changes**: Some duelists have different music than normal.
- **Starter Decks Adjusted**: Starter decks are based on the vanilla ones but have been adjusted for better balance.

## Known Issue
The only **unintentional property** you may encounter is a common **emulator bug**. This bug can cause the audio to glitch out, muting either some or all sound effects or music, and may produce a high-pitched sound. If this occurs, your game will eventually crash. It is recommended that you save your game, if possible, and reset the emulator.   
This bug happens in **any version of Duelists of the Roses**, including the vanilla version, and is **not related to Redux II**.
